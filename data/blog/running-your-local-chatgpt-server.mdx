Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a tourist visa to Greece. My name is Precious Voke Arikeri and I currently reside in the United Kingdom. I am planning to travel to Greece on February 9, 2023 and return on January 17, 2023.

The main purpose of my travel is to explore the magnificent sights of Greece with my friends. I had the opportunity to visit Santorini in 2021 with my partner and I had an amazing time, but unfortunately, we did not have enough time to explore the city fully. I am eager to return and experience more of the culture and history that Greece has to offer.

I am currently a student and my occupation status is student. My contact email address is preciousarikeri@gmail.com

I assure you that I am fully able to financially support myself during my stay in Greece and that I have no intention of overstaying my visa. I am also able to provide any additional documents that may be required.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to visit Greece.

Sincerely,
Precious Voke Arikeri.
```
